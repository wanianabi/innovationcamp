          <h2>How can we help children in underdeveloped countries
            to obtain an education through motivating them to stay in
            school?</h2>
          <h2>How can we help them shape a future?</h2>
          <h2>How can we make education interesting and motivating?</h2>
          <p>There are 130 million children across the world who are in
              school yet has not learned how to read, write or do math.
              What this shows is that the teachers struggle teaching their students.
              In some cases, this could be because of full classes. On the other hand
              it could be because the teacher does not see the point in teaching when
              they get paid for being there anyways. A lot of teachers in third world
              countries does not really have the competence to teach either, which also
              cause students to drop out.</p>
