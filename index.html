  <h3 id="tekst">How might we help children in underdeveloped countries
    to obtain an education through motivating them to stay in
    school? How might we help them shape a future? How might we
    make education interesting and motivating? </h3>
    <p id="paragraf1">There are 130 million children across the world who are in
    school yet has not learned how to read, write or do math.
    What this shows is that the teachers struggle teaching their students.
    In some cases, this could be because of full classes. On the other hand
    it could be because the teacher does not see the point in teaching when
    they get paid for being there anyways. A lot of teachers in third world
    countries does not really have the competence to teach either, which also
    cause students to drop out.</p>
