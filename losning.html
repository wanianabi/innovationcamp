    <h3>Pre-recorded videos</h3>
    <p>A possible solution to this problem could be showing pre-recorded videos.
       The videos will be of classes where a teacher goes through the syllabus
       for the year. To record them one simply needs a group teacher speaking a
       multitude of languages, a classroom and a camera. The videos will also have
       a sign language translation on it. A possible way of recording these videos
      could be through asking different teachers to record themselves while teaching
      a part of the syllabus. It could be done purely through charity.</p>

      <p> As the teacher no longer has to teach as much as before, they will have more
        time to follow up with the students and take attendance. The attendance can then
        be logged once a month into a database, where the children gets number IDs to keep
        them anonymous to everyone but the teacher. There could be an algorithm that could
        tell the teacher which students are in danger of falling behind and Save the Children
        can use the data to see if the attendance is getting better or worse.</p>

        <p> UNs sustainable development goal 4.1 states that everyone should have access to free
           and equal education. Through these videos students all over the world will have access
          to the same education, and they will have free access to the videos. Due to the videos being
           free to access, they could also be posted online, and used on the television for those who have
          access to those resources.</p>

          <p>As for the risks, it’s a possibility that someone might be tempted to steal the equipment,
            or that the government oppose to the videos being used or the ideas in the videos. However,
             if the government doesn’t want to receive help, the equipment can be used in other areas.
             To secure the equipment, one can hold the school responsible for it. That way they will
            make sure it’s stored safely.</p>

    <h3>How to play these vidoes?</h3>
    <p>Now, a problem here could be how to play these videos, especially at the schools
      without power, but the answer to that can be rather simple. The videos can be played
      by a DVD player connected to a projector. In countries where the school lacks power,
      one can use solar panels that are approximately half a square meter, size depends on
      manufacturer. This solar panels cost about 100 dollars and produce 70-100 watt.
      According to LUMERI iX280-W PROJEKTOR, projectors using led lights consume up to 70%
       less power than other projectors. The projector should also have speakers to reduce the
      number of products one buys.</p>

    <h3>Finances</h3>
    <p>The best way to get the money, would be through charity. For instance, on the page
      “partner with Us”, has a list of organizations known to donate to charity. Or the idea
      can be pitched to schools around Norway, and they could host fund raisers as well.</p>
